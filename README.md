## About 

The Daily App is a simple calendar app that was created using swift in Xcode and CocoaPods packages, as well as the Facebook login credientals
from the Facebook Developers site. The idea behind the Daily app wasn't just a calendar but a tool you would use daily - including a 
calendar. The features I had and still have in mind would combine a banking app, stock app and a calendar app all in one. You would be able to see
all your transactions in day view instead of date view. I figured people see there purchases in a date range but can't visualize it that day and time. That's 
where the Daily app into play, having the ability to see your purchases amonst all your all prorities and to maybe make some habit changes if you so feel you need too.

## Rality

In reality I didn't make the app as I wanted to simply because of the skill level and time it would take to produce such a product, I simple am not experienced enough
as the moment to take on such a project. However I was able to figure out Xcode and the calendar portion without ever touching the software so I plan to take on the project in time.
I may have bit off more than I can chew but that's okay, nothing is improssible and great ideas take time and perseverance.

# Usage

To use the app as of now you just simply put your Facebook credentials in and you're in the app - you can save your credentials and continue entering the app afterwards..
